This project is explained also at the top of project3.c, but essentially
it simulates a social network by using vertex and edge graphing and 
using the strength of a "friendship" by comparing the differences of 
qualities that exist of properties from each person. 

The code is ran by running <project3 "input_file"> which gives an output 
analysis.
